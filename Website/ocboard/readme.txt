# OC Webpage

## Introduction

This website is for any people who would want to read about my OC’s lore or see any art I might’ve drawn of them! Other than that, it also helps me keep track of my OCs. 


## Code Samples

I want this website to help other people show their creativity, find other people who also like making OCs or give any advice for me!

I don’t believe my website is really addressing any problems, it’s more of a small site that could become a community later on.

I hope people would enjoy this website, because I'm gonna love creating it!

## Installation

There's no installation process so don't worry!
